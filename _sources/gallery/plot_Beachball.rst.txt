Moment Tensor Plotting - Matrix Style
=======================================
This example shows how to create a heatmap of the moment tensor matrix

Let's start by creating a moment tensor, as the moment tensor is a symmetric
matrix we only need to define 6 of the 9 components

We are going to visualise the moment tensor in the common form of a beachball
defined by the microseismic event's focal mechanism. The plotting function
handles conversion of the six-component moment tensor to the focal mechanism
form desired by the ObSpy python package. After which, the beachball is drawn
and attached to the provided axis.
Here we utilise the function:
pyfrac.visualisation.momenttensor_plots.MTBeachball
