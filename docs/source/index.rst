FraCSPy
=======
Overview
========
FraCSPy is an open-source Python library focused on providing conventional microseismic monitoring tools, particularly for the purpose of benchmarking
newly proposed algorithms and workflows. 



Available Tools
---------------
In this first version, FraCSPy focuses on traditional monitoring tools (i.e., non-Machine Learning procedures). It has routines that cover the following 
elements of the microseismic monitoring pipeline: 
- detection
- localisation
- moment tensor determination

Alongside these core features, there are a number of functions available for data processing and for visualisation. 




History
-------
FraCSPy was initially written by senior researchers at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and GFZ 
German Research Centre for Geosciences, after they identified that the lack of available conventional algorithms for 
benchmarking purposes posed a key challenge for junior researchers.
