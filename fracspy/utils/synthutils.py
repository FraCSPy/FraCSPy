def add_noise(data:np.ndarray, noisetype:str="white", snr:float=1, trind:int=None, seed: int = None):
    r"""Contaminate seismic data with noise of different type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`
        Input seismic data of shape :math:`n_r \times n_t`
    noisetype: :obj:`str`, optional, default: "white"
        Type of noise: 
        "white" for random white noise, 
        "spiky" for noise that manifests as sharp spikes in the data.
        "ringy" for noise that  creates a ringing effect in the data.
    snr: :obj:`float`, optional, default: 1
        Signal-to-noise ratio to determine noise strength defined 
        as maximum amplitude of the signal divided by the maximum amplitude of noise
    trind: :obj:`int`, optional, default: None (add to all traces)
        Array of indices of traces to which noise must be added 
        (must be >= 0 and <= nr and non-repeating)
    seed: :obj:`int`, optional, default: None
        Seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility
    
    Returns
    -------
    ds_im_vol : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `trind` contains indices that are out of the valid range 
        (>= 0 and < nr) or if `trind` contains non-unique values.

    Notes
    -----
    Maximum amplitude of the signal is calculated as maximum amplitude of the input data.
    
    The ringing effect in seismic data refers to a specific type of noise or distortion that appears as a series of oscillations or reverberations in the seismic trace. This effect is characterized by a repetitive, wave-like pattern that continues after the main seismic event, resembling the ringing of a bell.
    Key aspects of the ringing effect include:
    - Appearance: It looks like a series of alternating positive and negative amplitudes that gradually decrease over time.
    - Causes: Ringing can be caused by various factors, including:
        - Instrument response: Poor coupling between the seismometer and the ground
        - Resonance in the recording system
        - Near-surface reverberations
        - Data processing artifacts, particularly from improper filtering
    - Impact: Ringing can obscure real seismic events and make interpretation difficult, especially for later arrivals or subtle features.
    - Frequency: The ringing often occurs at a characteristic frequency, which can help in identifying its source.
    - Duration: It can persist for a significant portion of the trace, sometimes lasting longer than the actual seismic signal of interest.
